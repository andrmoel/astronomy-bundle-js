Version 1.4.00 2017-04-22

   Compile with Visual Studio 2017.

Version 1.3.01 2014-08-30

   Fixed class cOrbit copy constructor/assignment operator: member variable
   m_secPeriod was not being propagated.
   Fixed potential memory leak in cSatellite::operator=().

Version 1.3.00 2014-06-27

   Added class cSatellite.
   Method cOrbit::GetPosition() is deprecated; use cOrbit::PositionEci().
   Destructors for classes cNoradSDP4 and cNoradSGP4 are now virtual.
   Added "orbitLib.h" header file.

Version 1.2.01 2013-09-08

   Added cOrbit::TleLine1() and TleLine2().

Version 1.2.00 2012-09-22

   Updates from orbitTools.core library:
      Class cCoordGeo renamed cGeo, added derived class cGeoTime.
      Class cCoordTopo renamed cTopo.
      Use new classes cEciTime, cGeoTime.

   Breaking changes:

   1. cOrbit::GetPosition() now returns type cEciTime.

Version 1.0.03 2011-05-31
   
   cJulian.FromJan1_12h_1900() renamed to FromJan0_12h_1900().   

Version 1.0.02 2011-09-25

   Compile with Visual Studio 2010.
   Class cOrbit constructor does not need to call cTle::Initialize().
   Class cOrbit's copy constructor initializes "recovered" caching variables.

   Performance changes: 

   1. Class Orbit now uses caching variables for common TLE orbital 
   parameters like inclination, argument of perigee, etc.

   Breaking changes:

   1. Removed unused method cOrbit::MeanAnomaly(cJulian).


Version 1.0.01 2010-12-31

   Removed unused local from class cNoradSDP4 c'tor.

Version 1.0.0 2010-10-30

   Split the orbitTools project into two libraries:

      core.lib  - base functionality (cTle, cJulian, etc.)
      orbit.lib - all SGP4/SDP4 tracking code
      
   Dividing the project into two libraries allows an easier upgrade path
   for users who wish to transition to licensed versions of the
   software.
              
   Breaking changes from prior (single library) version:
              
   All methods renamed to Pascal casing. Classes and methods affected:
        
      Class cNoradBase/cNoradSGP4/cNoradSDP4/cOrbit:
        getPosition() to GetPosition()
        
   Public methods with new signatures:
      Method cOrbit::GetPosition() - now returns type cEci instead of bool;
      the cEci parameter has been removed.
      
   Public methods with new behaviors:
      Method cOrbit::GetPosition() - can now throw new exception types
      cPropagationException and cDecayException.
      
   Other changes:

   Removed many unneeded member variables from cNoradBase and cNoradSDP4.
   Moved the functionality of cNoradSDP4::DeepInit() into the cNoradSDP4
   constructor, and no longer call the method on every GetPosition() calculation.
   This speeds up repetitive SDP4 position calculations by about 35%.
              
   Removed dp_savtsn; it was used to determine if the number of propagation
   minutes had changed by more than 30. If so, lunar-solar terms were
   recalculated. The terms are now always recalculated, regardless of 
   propagation time. This not only smooths ephemerides for some orbits, but
   also matches what was done in prior versions of the library.

   cNoradBase::Initialize() has been subsumed by the constructor.

   Compile with Visual Studio 2008.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Revision history below this point was for the single-library version of
  the source code. Only comments relevant to the files that were moved into
   the orbit.lib library have been retained. All other comments were moved 
           into the revision notes file for the core.lib library.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

09/11/2009 The variable "dpi_day" was not being initialized in cNoradSDP4.
           Thanks to H. Krispin et al.

01/02/2009 The orbit axis recovered from orbital elements is now correctly
           associated with the semimajor axis (and not the semiminor axis).
           This change does not effect SGP4/SDP4 output calculations, but
           does correct class cOrbit's convenience methods SemiMajor, SemiMinor,
           Major, Minor, etc. Thanks to C. Wee for discovering this issue.

           The cOrbit class method "mnMotionRec" was renamed to "MeanMotion".

06/21/2006 Since the cNoradBase class has a virtual function, good design
           practice dictates it also have a virtual destructor. A Gnu
           compiler warning sent by R. Graham.

07/19/2005 Fixed error in calculating m_kmPerigeeRec, which is not used by 
           SGP4 or SDP4 calculations. Added m_kmApogeeRec and corresponding
           accessor function cOrbit.Apogee().
           
12/07/2003 First writing.
